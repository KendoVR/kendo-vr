## Why KendoVR?

* Because we know how to create the best UI components for the web;

* Because we believe that VR will be one of the key aspects of future web development;

## What problem does KendoVR solve?

* A complete UI suite that would considerably speed-up WebVR development is yet not available on the market;

* VR poses a number of serious questions about UX, which can be also answered based on the considerable knowledge we have on traditional web development;

## How did we approached this topic?

* We have carefully examined the current state of WebVR and we decided to base our proof of concept on the most popular frameworks at this time - [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) and [three.js](https://threejs.org/)

* We decided to explore the possibilities to develop fully featured components using the above platforms;

## What is the final result?

* We have proved that development of VR components for the web is absolutely feasible;

* We have created a Grid, featuring data paging, sorting and templates;

* we have developed a Bubble chart visualizing 4 values for each of its data points and a complete navigation functionality;

* We have implemented a fully featured DropDownList;

* We have explored and offered a Switch functionality, also embedded in another component (Grid);
